    "               threads in Python ?\n",
    "   Ans :- \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently.\n",
    "   Multithreading is a threading technique in python programming to run multiple threads concurrently \n",
    "   by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching ).\n",
    "   Besides,it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information \n",
    "   and communication with other threads easier than individual processes.\n",
    "   Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves\n",
    "   the rendering of the application.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   It is a very useful technique for time-saving and improving the performance of an application.\n",
    "   Multithreading allows the programmer to divide application tasks into sub-tasks nad simultaneously run them in a program.\n",
    "   It allows threads to communicate and share resources such as files, data, and memory to the same processor.\n",
    "   Futhermore, it increases the user's responsiveness to continue running a program even if a part of the application \n",
    "   is the length or blocked.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Benefits of Multithreading in Python :\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Following are the benefits to create a multithreaded application in Python, as follows.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   1) It ensures effective utilization of computer system resources.\n",
    "   2) Multithreading applictions are more responsive.\n",
    "   3) It shares resources and its state with sub-threads (child) which makes it more economical.\n",
    "   4) It makes the multiprocessor architecture more effective due to similarity.\n",
    "   5) It save time by executing multiple threads at the same time.\n",
    "   6) The system does not require too much memory to store multiple threads.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   There are two main modules of multithreading used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1) The thread module\n",
    "   2) The threading module                                                      \n",

    "   Deadlocks :\n",
    "   \n",
    "   When two processes are waiting for each other directly or indirectly, it is called deadlock.\n",
    "   This usually occurs when two processes are waiting for shared resources acquired by others.\n",
    "   For example, if thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplishits task.\n",
    "   But the resource R2 is acquired by thread T2 which is waiting for resource R1 (which is acquired by by T1).\n",
    "   Neither of them will be able to accomplish its task, as they keep waiting for other resources they need.\n",
    "   A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occures.\n",
    "   The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be\n",
    "   terminated forcefully.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   There are many ways in which you may encounter a deadlock in your concurrent program. Deadlocks are not developed\n",
    "   intentionally, instead, they are an unexpected side effect or bug in concurrency programming.\n",
    "   Common examples of the cause of threading deadlocks include :\n",
    "   1) A thread that waits on itself (e.g. attempts to acquire the same mutex lock twice ).\n",
    "   2) Threads that wait on each other (e.g. A waits on B, B waits on A ).\n",
    "   3) Thread that fails to release a resource (e.g. mutex lock , semaphore , barrier , condition , event , etc ).\n",
    "   4) Threads that acquire mutex lock in different orders (e.g. fail to perform lock ordering ).\n",
    "   Deadlocks may be easy to describe , but hard to detect in an application just from reading cpde.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Race Conditions :\n",
    "   \n",
    "   When two processes are competing with each other causing data coruption.\n",
    "   For example, if two processes/threads are trying to execute the following conditions simultaneously, they cause data \n",

    "   total= num1 + num2\n",
    "   Thread 2 :\n",

    "   \n",
