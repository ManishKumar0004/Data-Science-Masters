    "\"\"\"Q-1: What is Abstraction in oops ? Explain with an example ?\n",
    "   Ans:- \n",
    "       Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the user.\n",
    "       The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function,but inner working is hidden.User is \n",
    "       familiar\n",
    "       with that \"what function does\" but they don't know \"how it does\".\n",
    "       \n",
    "       In simple words,we all use the smartphone and very much familiar with its functions such as camera,voice-recorder,\n",
    "       call-dialing, etc., but we don't know how these operations are happening in the background.\n",
    "       Let's take another example- when we use TV remote to increase the volume. We don't know how pressing a \n",

    "       the volume of the TV.We only know to press the \"+\" button to increase the volume.\n",
