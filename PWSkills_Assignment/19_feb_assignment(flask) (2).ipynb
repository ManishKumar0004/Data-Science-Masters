    "\n",
    "<strong>Flask is a web framework that provides libraries to build lightweight web applications in python. It is developed by Armin Ronacher who leads an international group of python enthusiasts (POCCO). It is based on WSGI (web server gateway interface) toolkit and jinja2 template engine. Flask is considered as a micro framework.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong> WSGI:\n",
    "It is an acronym for web server gateway interface which is a standard for python web application development. It is considered as the specification for the universal interface between the web server and web application.\n",
    "Jinga2:\n",
    "Jinja2 is a web template engine which combines a template with a certain data source to render the dynamic web pages.</strong>\n",

    "<strong>Advantages of Flask Framework:-</strong><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> 1) It is a lightweight framework that offers hassle-free development.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>2) Provide flexibility to the developer to experiment with their modules or architecture.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>3) It is suitable for small projects.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>4) Offers a built-in development server and fast debugger.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>5) Easily scalable for the applications.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>6) Support for secure cookies.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>7) Uses Ninja2 Template engine.</b>\n",
    "<b>8) It has integrated support for unit testing.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>9) APIs are coherent and neat.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>10) Provide strong WSGI support.</b>\n"
